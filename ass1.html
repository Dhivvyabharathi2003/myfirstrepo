    <h1>Welcome to VSB</h1>
    <P>Parrots are colorful, intelligent birds found in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. Known for their ability to mimic human speech, 
        they belong to the order Psittaciformes, which includes over 393 species. Parrots have strong, curved beaks and zygodactyl feet, meaning
         they have two toes pointing forward and two backward, aiding in climbing and grasping. They are social animals, often living in flocks, and many species are
          known for their playful behavior. Conservation efforts are crucial as many parrot species face threats from habitat loss and the pet trade.</P>
